abstract: "<p><b>Abstract</b>. Collecting data from students solving programming tasks is valuable for both researchers and educators. Such data can be used to analyze student behavior, identify errors and misconceptions, and for many other purposes. In this work, we propose KOALA, a configurable tool to collect student data using JetBrains IDEs. This tool collects code snapshots and IDE interactions, converts them into the ProgSnap2 format, and provides visualization analysis.</p>"
