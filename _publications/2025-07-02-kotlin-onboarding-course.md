abstract: "<p><b>Abstract</b>. Project-Based Learning (PBL) emphasizes real-world problem-solving and critical thinking, while in-IDE learning integrates education directly into professional Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), promoting focus and skill development. This paper introduces the Kotlin Onboarding in-IDE project-based course, which combines the advantages of both approaches. Covering CS1 concepts in Kotlin, it targets students with prior programming experience who are adopting Kotlin as a secondary language. Published on JetBrains Marketplace and integrated into university curricula, the course has received positive feedback and shown high engagement.</p>"
