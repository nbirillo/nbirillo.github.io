Hello! My name is Anastasiia, and I am the Head of the **Education Research** lab at [JetBrains Research](https://www.jetbrains.com/research/). I am also an external PhD student

Assistant in Programming Education”_ between [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/) and JetBrains. 


In 2020, I obtained a Master's degree from [Saint Petersburg State University](https://english.spbu.ru/), Department of Mathematics and Mechanics. Before that, in 2017, I obtained the 
Bachelor's degree from the same university. In parallel to my Master's education, I also graduated from Computer Science Center with triple major: Data Science, Software Engineering, and Computer Science.

I taught classes in the following universities:
* From 2020 to 2022: [Saint Petersburg State University](https://english.spbu.ru/)
