abstract: "<p><b>Hyperstyle</b> is a tool for clustering MOOC submissions for diversifying presentation. This tool first standardizes solutions that are algorithmically the same, then calculates the structure-aware edit distance between them, and then applies clustering. Finally, it selects one example from each of the largest clusters, taking into account their code quality.</p>"
