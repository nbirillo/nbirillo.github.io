abstract: "<p><b>Abstract</b>. Debugging is an essential skill in programming education. Current debugging approaches lack interactivity and personalization for students. To address this gap, we introduce an AI Debugging Assistant integrated into JetBrains IDEs. The tool analyzes the students' errors in real-time and guides them through the debugging process by recommending breakpoints and explaining them on each step. This poster invites discussion on the effectiveness of the AI Debugging Assistant and its implications for programming education. </p>"
