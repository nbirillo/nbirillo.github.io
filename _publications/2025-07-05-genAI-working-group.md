abstract: "<p><b>Abstract</b>. GenAI is playing an increasingly important role in computing courses at all levels, offering new opportunities to support teaching and learning. However, using GenAI effectively raises important concerns regarding trust, academic integrity, and broader social and ethical dimensions. This Working Group was formed to report on the current state of the art in using GenAI in upper-level computing courses to aid educators. The working group will undertake a methodological review of published work and solicit input from the computing educational community as part of the report.</p>"
