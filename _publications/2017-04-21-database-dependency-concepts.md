abstract: '<p><b>Abstract</b>. A database dependency is a formal concept which is used to describe patterns in data. These patterns are employed during data analysis, data cleansing, and schema normalization. There is about dozen of major dependency types.</p><p>In this paper we survey these types of database dependencies employed in the relational databases. We start from the earliest ones â€” functional dependencies and conclude with the state-ofthe-art findings. For each type we provide both formal and nonformal definitions and present an example and counterexample. We also briefly discuss extraction algorithms and possible use cases.</p>'
