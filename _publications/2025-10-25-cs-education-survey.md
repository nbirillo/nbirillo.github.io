abstract: "<p><b>Abstract</b>. Computer science education is a dynamic field with many aspects that influence the learner’s path. While these aspects are usually studied in depth separately, it is also important to carry out broader large-scale studies that touch on many topics, because they allow us to put different results into each other’s perspective. Past large-scale surveys have provided valuable insights, however, the emergence of new trends (e.g., AI), new learning formats (e.g., in-IDE learning), and the increasing learner diversity highlight the need for an updated comprehensive study. To address this, we conducted a survey with 18,032 participants from 173 countries, ensuring diverse representation and exploring a wide range of topics — formal education, learning formats, AI usage, challenges, motivation, and more. This paper introduces the results of this survey as an open dataset, describes our methodology and the survey questions, and highlights, as a motivating example, three possible research directions within this data: challenges in learning, emerging formats, and insights into the in-IDE format. The dataset aims to support further research and foster advancements in computer education.</p>"
